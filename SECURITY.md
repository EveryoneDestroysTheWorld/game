# Security policy
Typically, most bugs can be easily reported using the [issues](https://github.com/EveryoneDestroysTheWorld/game/issues/new/choose) in this repository. However, some bugs require confidentiality before we announce them to the public. Exploiters can take advantage of critical bugs if they are disclosed inappropriately.

Use caution before posting to the issues list. When in doubt, report bugs to everyonedestroystheworld@beastslash.com instead.
